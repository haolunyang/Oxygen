## Spatial Brainstorm, Powered by AI.
Currently, peopleâ€™s thoughts and creativities are limited to a 2D canvas, and their thoughts have no connection with the spatial context. With Oxygen, you can have an infinite canvas to capture your inspirations, while connecting them with your environment and elevating them with AI.

## Learn to create your own visionOS app with Oxygen
We are designers who code, and Oxygen is our way of contributing to a future in which every designer can prototype with real code and design "how it works."

If you are also starting to learn SwiftUI for visionOS to get ready for the era of spatial computing, Oxygen has all the fundamental components you will need to start, including SwiftUI, USDZ model, immersive space, connecting to OpenAI API, etc.
